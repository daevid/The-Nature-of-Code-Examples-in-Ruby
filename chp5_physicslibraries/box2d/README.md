These examples were created for the [pbox2d gem][] version 0.1.2 which is loosely based on Dan Shiffmans Box2D for processing. So currently should be very understable from the book, future versions of the pbox2d gem may be radically different as there is some scope for more ruby like refactoring (eg constructors that take hash input etc).
